## Alignment Check
- **Direction**: Re-check goals/constraints/DoD in PROJECT.md. Are we drifting?
- **Rigor**: What's evidence vs hypothesis? What needs investigation/verification next?
- **Coordination**: Ask @peers for risks/suggestions/objections. Synthesize and update Context.

## Evidence vs Hypothesis
- **Evidence**: Verified facts (tests passed, logs confirmed, API responses, etc.)
- **Hypothesis**: Unverified assumptions (note what's needed to verify)

## Escalation Triggers
Escalate to user if any:
- 2 attempts failed to resolve
- External permissions/credentials needed
- Requirements/goals unclear

## Self-Optimization Check
1. **Review Context Notes** - Any new lessons learned?
2. **Identify codifiable rules** - Which lessons should be added to CLAUDE.md?
3. **Verify compliance** - Were recent tasks executed per standards?
   - Was peer work verified before marking done?
   - Were executable actions performed directly (not delegated to user)?
4. **Execute updates** - Update CLAUDE.md or Context Notes (if applicable)
